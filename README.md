# IndianHousingPrice-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the diverse factors that influence house prices in our country and categorize them accordingly. However, due to the cultural and economic variations across different cities and states, it presents challenges to establish a uniform set of factors applicable to all locations. In urbanized cities like Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai, where population density is high, there are common factors such as amenities (hospitals, gyms, swimming pools) and furnishings (wardrobes, ACs, TVs, furniture) that significantly impact housing prices. By examining this data, we can draw conclusions about specific locations or types of apartments, determining their costs and identifying the most suitable tenants for each scenario.

Moreover, our project goes beyond mere analysis by offering visualizations of amenities in different cities. It conducts comparisons among various types of cities, identifies correlations between amenities, and ultimately maps out all available locations. By visualizing the amenities, users gain a comprehensive understanding of the facilities provided in each city and how they influence housing prices. The mapping feature facilitates easy identification of the distribution of amenities, empowering users to make well-informed decisions based on their specific preferences and needs.
